Development of Riece uses CVS, Concurrent Versions System.
Latest developing version is available at CVS.

However, you must notice that it is intentional that we don't include
this file in the tarball and don't put the repository address on the
Web site.  That is, pointless complaints about development versions
are _unwelcome_ for us.  If you are a beginning user, who just wants
to try the product (where on earth did you get this version?), check
the released version.
