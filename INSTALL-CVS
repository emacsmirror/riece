The development of Riece uses CVS, Concurrent Versions System.
The latest development version is available from cvs.m17n.org.

However, you should notice that it is intentional that we don't put
the repository address on the Web site.  That is, pointless complaints
about development versions are _unwelcome_ to us.  If you are a
beginning user, who just wants to try the product, check out the
released version.
