Riece is mainly written by Daiki Ueno <ueno@unixuser.org>.

The development of Riece has started to redesign the Liece IRC client.
Liece is based on Irchat (version 3.01) which has been distributed
under GNU General Public License version 1 or later.  Liece was mainly
written by the same author of Riece.  Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi> is
the original author of Irchat.  See doc/irchat-copyright.el for the
original copyright statement of Irchat.

Riece has code borrowed from other elisp packages such as Gnus,
Emacs-w3m, ECB, and SEMI.  I would like to thank the developers of
these packages.
