;;; Commentary:

;; NOTE: This is an add-on module for Riece.

;; This program allows to connect to an IRC server via local proxy
;; which responds to PING requests from server.

;; If you want to enable this feature per server, write the server
;; spec like this:
;; (add-to-list 'riece-server-alist
;;              '("async" :host "irc.tokyo.wide.ad.jp"
;;                :function riece-async-open-network-stream))

;;; Code:
